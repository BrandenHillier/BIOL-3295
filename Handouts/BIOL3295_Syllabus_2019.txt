Pre-requisites: BIOL 2600; at least one of BIOL 2010, 2122 or 2210.	Course format:Prior to lecture. Readings are to be completed before some lectures (see 1.1 Lecture Schedule and 1.3 Readings for more details).Lecture. There are 3 x 50 minute lectures each week. Lectures will be a combination of me lecturing and you problem solving, running simulations, and analyzing data to understand how to answer research questions in population and evolutionary ecology.* Plan to bring a laptop computer with the recommended software installed (see 1.5 Software for installation instructions). Labs. There are 8 x 3 hour labs. See 1.2 Lab Schedule.Course expectations: Any students that are disruptive, violating university policies, or acting in a potentially unsafe way will be warned and asked to leave.	    Learning goals* Understand key concepts* Perform calculations* Know how to gain knowledge and assess information sources* Gain some experience running simulations and coding Required Text and Readings* I will conduct a computing resources survey on the first day of class. Please notify me if you have limited access to computing resources.* All readings are available online via the links in 1.3 Readings, or can be accessed via the library website.* Brightspace – will be used: a) to make announcements (in addition to in class); b) for class-related emails; c) to disseminate grades; d) for students to post questions on the readings.* Github – Lecture slides, Labs, and other resources will be available to download at https://github.com/ahurford/BIOL-3295Method of Evaluation* Assignments 20%* Midterm (take home) 20%* Labs 20%* Final exam 40%Late assignments, labs, and missed midterms, and final exams will be accommodated as described by University Regulation 6.7.3 and 6.7.5 (see https://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0474 for Regulations). The Final exam will cover all Lecture material and readings, but not Labs. Specific regulations governing final examinations are described by University Regulation 6.8. Lecture participation is highly recommended and practice problems completed during lectures may appear on Assignments.1.1 Lecture scheduleWeek 1Fri Sept 6What is a population and why does is matter?Week 2Tues Sept 10What is evolutionary ecology?* Björklund, 2019.Estimating population size* Sacchi et al., 2002.(Skalski et al., 2005. 8.1.2 Basic Sampling Methods and 8.2 Description of Common Indices. p363-394 – Read only if you are interested in additional details)Week 3Tues Sept 17Discrete and continuous time population dynamics                      Assignment 1 setExponential/geometric growth* Vandermeer and Goldberg, 2013. p1-8 (beginning after the Exercises on p4)Week 4Tues Sept 24Density dependence* Vandermeer and Goldberg, 2013.

The journal articles should be accessible via the links, but you might also be able to access them via Web of Science from the library website.* See 1.1 Lecture Schedule for the timing of the readings and see 1.4 References for full bibliographic information.* Prior to the day that a reading is due, you should post any questions or comments you have on the reading to the Discussion on BrightSpace. If you are having trouble viewing any of the required readings, please contact myself, or a teaching assistant.* Please consult “How to Read a Scientific Paper” (2014) for the recommended approach to ‘reading’ journal articles. Steps 1,2, and 4 are good advice, but step 3 may not be relevant for some readings.* Readings from textbooks (i.e., Vandermeer and Goldberg, 2013) can be read linearly (from beginning to end).1.4 References (It is recommended to cut and paste links into a web browser to access journal articles; alternatively follow the instructions from ‘Guide for accessing readings.docx’)Andow, D.A., Kareiva, P.M., Levin, S.A., Okubo, A., 1990.

Accommodations are provided within the scope of the University Policies for the Accommodations for Students with Disabilities (www.mun.ca/policy/site/policy.php?id=239). Students who may need an academic accommodation are asked to initiate the request with the Glenn Roy Blundon Centre at the earliest opportunity (www.mun.ca/blundon). Academic misconductStudents are expected to adhere to those principles, which constitute proper academic conduct. A student has the responsibility to know which actions, as described under Academic Offences in the University Regulations, could be construed as dishonest or improper. Students found guilty of an academic offence may be subject to a number of penalties commensurate with the offence including reprimand, reduction of grade, probation, suspension or expulsion from the University. For more information regarding this policy, students should refer to University Regulation 6.12. Equity and DiversityA safe learning environment will be provided for all students regardless of race, colour, nationality, ethnic origin, social origin, religious creed, religion, age, disability, disfigurement, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, family status, source of income or political opinion.You should not photograph or record myself, teaching assistants, or other students in the class without first obtaining permission. Accommodation will be made for students with special needs.The sound should be turned off on phones and computers during class.Additional SupportsResources for additional support can be found at:* www.mun.ca/currentstudents/student/* https://munsu.ca/resource-centres/BIOL 3295: Dr. Amy Hurford6
