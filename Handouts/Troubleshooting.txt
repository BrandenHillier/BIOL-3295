# In R or RStudio
1. "sm" package won't install.
-- Need to install X11 from https://www.xquartz.org/

2. Packages won't install with an error message related to directory permissions
-- Antivirus software was preventing installations. R and RStudio needed to be added as 'exceptions' for the virus software. The problem was identified, in part, by trying to install the package in R (bypassing RStudio).

# Github Desktop
1. Error message mentioned permissions.
-- Github desktop was installed via @memorial-guest wifi. The problem was resolved after reinstallation with download via another network.
