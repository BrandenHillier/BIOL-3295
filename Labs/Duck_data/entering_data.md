# How to enter your duck data

You will add your data to the class comma-separated value (CSV) file, which is a plain text format for spreadsheets. CSV files can be viewed and edited with many applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc, Google Sheets, R). 

Depending on your Operating System, when you double click on the file, it will be opened by the default application, like Microsoft Excel. If the data is not displaying correctly, you can adjust the width of the columns. Next, enter the data in the row that corresponds to your name. Include the time of your observation (e.g. 2pm) and the number of ducks that you counted. If you have any additional information, you can include it under the "Notes" column. 

After entering your data, you need to save the spreadsheet in the csv format again. Select "File" -> "Save As..." -> In the "Format" drop-down menu select "Comma-Separated Values (.csv)" -> Click "Save". This may prompt the warning "This workbook contains features that will not work or may be removed if you save it in the selected file format. Do you want to continue?" - Click "Continue" to proceed with saving the file. If you are prompted by an additional warning concerning the encoding of the file, select the option "UTF-8 encoding" to prevent including unwanted special characters in your file.
