# Lab 1. Starting out.

You should hand in your write up of Lab 1 at the start of next week's lab: Wednesday Sept 19 at 2pm.

The goals for Lab 1 are:
1. Everyone gets RStudio and R installed.
2. Some R and programming basics
3. Everyone gets Github Desktop installed (or learns about how to work with Git or Github instead).
4. Everyone knows how to access the Readings.

## 1. Everyone gets RStudio and R installed (seek Instructor help)
The links to download RStudio and R are provided in the Syllabus (Section 1.5 Software). If you are still having problems downloading this software please seek help from Dr. Hurford, Jake, or Joany. If you are working on a lab computer these software will already be installed and you can skip this step.

## 2. Some R and programming basics

In this section we will cover:

- Understand that RStudio is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that makes running R easier (Instructor demo)
- Know what the Console does versus the Text Editor (Instructor demo)
- Know how to run a whole script versus a subset of the commands (Instructor demo)
- Practice some basic commands: load a package, load in data, basic algebra, built-in functions, user-defined functions, make a for loop, create and manipulate a dataframe.
- Some common errors and how to fix code errors.

You should now open the file IntroToR.R in RStudio. This file contains the instructions for what you are to hand in.

## 3. Everyone gets Github Desktop installed (Instructor demo/help)
- See also 'Working with the class Github repository.pdf'.
- Practice both 'Download ZIP' and 'open in Desktop'.
- Note that you can read (and edit) some files directly in Github.
- Understand the advantages of Github.

## 4. Everyone knows how to access the Readings (Instructor demo)
See also the file 'Guide for accessing readings.pdf'
