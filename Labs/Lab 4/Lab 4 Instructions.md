# BIOL 3295 Lab 4: Is flour beetle population growth density-dependent?

**Lab report due: Wed Oct 8 at 2pm**

- The goal of this lab is to use model fitting and statistics to determine if flour beetle (_Tribolium castaneum_) population growth is density-dependent.

Data are from the article _Ghosts of habitats past: environmental carry-over effects drive population dynamics in novel habitat_ by Benjamin G. van Allen and Volker H. W. Rudolf.

(1) Download the file `Tribolium.csv` and save it somewhere you will be able to find it again. To download just this file, you should download it from `BrightSpace`.

(2) Open the `Tribolium.csv` file in `Microsoft Excel`, or view the .csv file on the Github repository website to see what the data look like. Do not make any changes to the saved data.

(3) Download `Flourbeetle.R`. To download just this file download it from `BrightSpace`.

(4) Open `Flourbeetle.R` in `RStudio`. Read through all the text in this code and when you come to a line of code that is executable `Run` it (i.e. run the commands in black, you do not need to run the comments in green). There is a lot of text and I expect that it will take a while to read through this code. You will need to set the path to `Tribolium.csv`, but once you have done that the entire code should run by clicking `Source'. Nonetheless, you should step through the code, line-by-line, to know what is going on.

To hand in:
1. You need to hand in one of the graphs that the script `Flourbeetle.R` produces: there are four possibilities, the choice is yours. The graph you submit needs to include informative axes labels, and a figure caption explaining all the parameter values and what the different line types and points represent. In addition to the figure caption, provide 1 paragraph that explains whether the graph you have chosen shows density dependence and that reports the name of the statistical test used to reach that conclusion, any associated best fit parameter values, and p-values associated with your statistical test. If you run through the code line-by-line, you should know which statistical tests are associated with which figures, however, if you just `Source` the code and don't read through everything this may be hard to figure out.
