For this lab, we will simulate the evolutionay dynamics of _Drosophilia melongaster_, particularly, with respect to the evolution of maturity:

1. Open `RStudio` and install the package `popbio`.
2. Download and run the file `Yellow_Columbine_Stage_Structure.R`. This code will produce 2 graphs: 1) the number of seeds over time, and 2) the number of the different types of plants over time.

3.	Into the R console type:
```
> head(aq.trans)
```
