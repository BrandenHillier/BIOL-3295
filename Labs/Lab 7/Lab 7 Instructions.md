# Lab 7: Spatially explicit population dynamics
(This file is best viewed on the Github website - and other .md files too)

This lab report is due Thursday Nov 7 at 12pm (in lecture - there is no lab next week)

## Background
This lab uses `Netlogo` to simulate disease dynamics in a sheep population. The model is:
* _An Agent-Based Model_: this means that individuals are represented in the simulation.
* _Stochastic_: this means that events occur with a fixed probability, but on any given run of the simulation, the outcome may be different, i.e., such as a coin toss, the probabiilty of a heads is fixed, but for any given toss a heads may occur or not.
* _Spatially explicit_:

Open the file `Local_SI.nlogo` in the `NetLogo` program.
