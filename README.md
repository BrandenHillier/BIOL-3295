# Announcements

- Assignment 2 is now posted. Assignment 2 is due Friday October 11 at 1pm.
- I will consider any work you hand in late, if you let me know the situation, and within reason. For example, if you want to hand in Assignment 2 on Wednesday Oct 16, that is fine. If you couldn't get part of a lab done because you couldn't install a package, come get help, and hand in your work afterwards for credit.
