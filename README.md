- Typo corrected on the midterm. In question 1, assume lambda > 1 (corrected from lambda > 0). In addition, in part 1c, the recommendation of testing for lambda = 2 (corrected from lambda = 1).
- The midterm is posted! It is due Nov 1.
- Thursday and Friday this week, I will review what we have done in class so far, and discuss problems that could appear on the final exam.
